*Computer Vision Library for D Programming Language*

## About

DCV is an open source computer vision library, written in D programming language, with goal to provide tools for solving most common computer vision problems - various image processing tasks, feature detection and tracking, camera calibration, stereo etc.

## Focus

Focus of the library is to present an easy-to-use interface, that would attract computer vision scientists and engineers to prototype their solutions with, but also to provide fast running code that could be used to make production ready tools and applications.

## API

DCV's API heavily utilizes [Mir](https://github.com/libmir/mir) library, and it's `mir.ndslice` package. N-dimensional range view 
structure [Slice](https://github.com/libmir/mir/blob/master/source/mir/ndslice/slice.d) is used for any form of image manipulation 
and processing. But overall shape of the API is adopted from well known computer vision toolkits such as Matlab Image Processing 
Toolbox, and OpenCV library, to be easily familiarized with. But it's also spiced up with D's syntactic sugar, to support pipelined calls:

```d
Image image = imread("/path/to/image.png"); // read an image from filesystem.

auto slice = image.sliced; // slice image data (calls mir.ndslice.slice.sliced on image data)

slice[0..$, 0..$, 1] // take the green channel only.
    .as!float // convert slice data to float.
    .slice // make a copy
    .conv!symmetric(sobel!float(GradientDirection.DIR_X)) // convolve image with horizontal Sobel kernel.
    .ranged(0, 255) // scale values to fit the range between the 0 and 255
    .imshow("Sobel derivatives"); // preview changes on screen.

waitKey();
```

## Documentation
