# Image convolution example


This example should demonstrate how to perform 2D (convolution)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)] to an image. 
Should also provide insight to basic setup for any image processing, such as image i/o, image convertion to Slice object etc.


## Modules used
* dcv.core.image - Image
* dcv.core.utils - Slice.asType
* dcv.io - imread, imwrite
