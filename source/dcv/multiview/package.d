/**
 * Module implements methods for multiview geometry (camera calibration, 3D scene reconstruction, etc.)
 * 
 * v0.1 norm:
 * multiview fundamentals - homography, essential and fundamental matrix etc.
 * basic camera calibration techniques (using planar object, auto-calibration with bundle adjustment, ???)
 * basic stereo calibration (using 3D object, planar object)
 * image undistortion, 3D reconstruction ???
